# Jumpin Jive Jukebox
This is a sample project I am working on for fun, creating a cloud-based music player to replace my Google Play Music account after Google terminated the service. Basic underlying technologies are React, Redux, TypeScript, Webpack. The jukebox gets data from a Firebase Realtime Database and streams music from an AWS S3 storage account.
